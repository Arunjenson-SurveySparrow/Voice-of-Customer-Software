          Voice of Customer Software: Do You Need One
        </h2>
        <p>
          The voice of customer is a methodology that has gained immense
          momentum across businesses worldwide. With VoC, you can extract the
          expectations of your customers, directly and indirectly. Market
          research, focus groups, email surveys, and the likes fall under direct
          interaction which helps to gather customer views at every touch-point
          while online reviews, social media helps to keep up-to-date with
          customer expectations and trends without much direct interaction.

            <p>
              Pick a voice of customer software that has a sleek interface to
              boast of. Surveys are known to be mundane, but when you draft a
              voice of customer survey that has the right questions, expect
              excellent numbers regarding the completion rates. Features like
              conditional logic branching display what’s relevant and hide the
              rest. A voice of customer software that helps you build
              personalized VoC surveys will further spike the response rates.

            <p>
              With the right voice of customer software by your side, simplify
              the task of collecting data & feedback. Multiple options to share
              surveys like email surveys, social media, web links, SMS option,
              etc, widens the reach of surveys and allows your customers to pick
              out a channel most convenient to them. If your voice of customer
              software comes with multi-device capability, then be sure that
              it’s a great pick. Tablet, mobile or desktop, your customers can
              take surveys anytime!

              Businesses function smoothly by employing a host of multiple tools
              that integrate and run together as one big unit. A stand-alone
              voice of customer software is of little use. Thus make sure that
              the software you pick has the capability to integrate with other
              third-party tools. Be it through webhooks or the popular Zapier
              integration, connect your voice of customer software with your
              favorite tools to create an efficient workflow.

            <h4>Automate Recurring Tasks</h4>
            <p>
              A strong voice of customer program requires continuous and
              consistent implementation. Moreover, an essential element of it
              includes sending the voice of customer surveys to customers to
              collect feedback from them. However, repeatedly sending the same
              surveys wastes time and resources, not to mention the mundanity
              that comes along with it. Thus, pick out a voice of customer
              software that offers the feature of sending automated pulse
              surveys.

            <h4>Real-time Data Capture & Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              Needless to say, implementing a VoC program is with the aim of
              getting insights about customer trends, requirements, and
              expectations. A voice of customer software must be adept at
              analyzing survey results to the very granular level in order to
              tap valuable insights. Furthermore, your voice of customer
              software must capture customer data real-time, instantaneously.
              Waiting for results for hours makes the ordeal futile and
              cumbersome.
